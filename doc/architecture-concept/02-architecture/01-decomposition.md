## 2.1.1 Roles

This section describes the roles that directly participate in credential issuance, storage, presentation, and verification.

In Romania, the PID Provider is the General Directorate for Persons' Records (DGEP), while the Wallet Provider is the General Directorate for Communications and Information Technology, both operating under the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA).

| Name                          | Abbreviation | Description                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User                          | USER         | Entity that uses the Wallet. Natural person to whom the PID belongs. |
| PID Provider                  | PP           | Entity that verifies the identity of the User, issues the PID to the User's Wallet and publishes information to let Relying Parties verify the validity of the PID. |
| EAA Provider                  | EP           | Entity that issues Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAA), including QEAA and PubEAA, to the User's Wallet. |
| Wallet Provider               | WP           | Entity that provides the Wallet Solution. |
| Relying Party                 | RP           | Entity that relies on the PID. |
| Mobile Platform Provider      | MPP          | Entity that provides platform attestations about the integrity of the User Device and the installed Wallet App and push notifications to the WI. |

**PID Provider**

The PID Provider is the General Directorate for Persons' Records (DGEP), operating under the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA).

A PID Provider is a trusted entity responsible for:

- verifying the identity of the user in compliance with Level of Assurance (LoA) high requirements,
- issuing a Person Identification Data (PID) credential to the EUDI Wallet, and
- making available, in a privacy-preserving manner, information that allows Relying Parties to verify the validity of the PID.

The PID Provider ensures that person identification data is securely generated, validated, and made available to the wallet. The PID Provider forms part of the core infrastructure of the RO Wallet Ecosystem. The current ecosystem vision foresees a single PID Provider, while allowing for future evaluation of additional issuance methods that meet the defined functional and security requirements.

**(Q-, Pub-) EAA Provider**

A (Qualified, Public or domain-driven) Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA) Provider is an entity responsible for issuing Electronic Attestations of Attributes at the user’s request.

EAAs allow users to prove specific attributes in a secure, standardized, and legally recognized way.

Qualified EAA (QEAA) Providers meet the highest eIDAS 2.0 trust and security requirements and issue legally binding attestations recognized across borders.
Public EAA (Pub-EAA) Providers are trusted public entities issuing legally recognized, but non-qualified, attestations.

EAA Providers are trustworthy parties in the EUDI Wallet Ecosystem and provide digital attestations in their specific domain. EAA Providers may originate from various domains such as mobility, telecommunications, education, or healthcare. They are typically supervised by competent authorities within their respective domains. The EUDI Wallet ecosystem envisions multiple EAA Providers as well as QEAA- and Pub-EAA Providers.

**QES Provider / Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP)**

Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) provide legally binding signatures for digital documents. QES are regulated by the eIDAS framework and recognized by all EU member states. They have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature. QES are technically based on digital signatures using certificates.

EUDI Wallet Providers must offer users free Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) for non-professional use within a wallet-centric QES approach. To fulfil this requirement, Wallet Providers may collaborate with Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs). A QTSP is a trust service provider that has received qualified status from a supervisory body in an EU Member State, allowing it to provide qualified trust services with legal effects equivalent to handwritten signatures across the EU.

Besides free-of-charge QES, there will also be the option to use QES Services for any use case. The EUDI Wallet Ecosystem interacts with multiple QES Providers / QTSPs listed in the specific EU Trust Lists.

**Wallet Provider**

The Wallet Provider is the General Directorate for Communications and Information Technology (DGCTI), also operating under the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA).

An EUDI Wallet Provider develops and operates wallet solutions that store, manage, and present credentials on behalf of users. Wallet Providers ensure the secure handling of sensitive cryptographic material (e.g. private keys) and guarantee that users retain sole control over their PID, EAAs, and other personal data.


**Relying Parties**

A Relying Party (RP) is an entity (public or private) that interacts with EUDI Wallets to verify identity data or attributes for authentication, authorization, or service access.

Relying Parties must register and declare their intended use of EUDI Wallet data to ensure compliance with eIDAS 2.0 and ecosystem rules.
